<p><h2>Why? and How? and What?</h2></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>So our <b>suggested solution</b> is that the company make some form of <b>app</b> in order to handle the influx of customers.</li><br>

<li>This app will be mobile to allow them to order ahead of their trip to the restaurant (much like Taco Bell) as well as an app that can be used in-store by employees to take orders.</li>
<br>
<li>This system will also have a built in loyalty program, which allows customers to gain rewards from the amount of points they spend, and also randomly get awarded loyalty things.</li>
<br>
<li>They will also be given cool stuff based on major days, like their birthday.</li>
<br>
<li>We are targeting most demographics.</li>
<br>
<li>With the app, we are targeting mostly centennials that use smart phones, but the use of the in-store loyalty app allows us to target all demographics by way of e-mail rewards.</li>
<br>
<li>The point is to make it simple and easy to use for all generations. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here are pictures from Starbucks' mobile application.</p>
