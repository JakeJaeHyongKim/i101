<h1>Hi, I'm Jake</h1>
<p>Welcome to my website, and I hope you can find what you want to find in here. Again, thank you!</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<img src="Jake.jpg"/>
<p>First of all, I would like to start with my personal statement as an entrepreneur. One of my role model as a serial entrepreneur, Peter Thiel said that “the next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the Next Mark Zukerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.”
For the past 3 years, I have been either founded or co-founded three different companies with all different ideas and people. I have had my strong belief when I founded or joined the team when it kicks off. VisuKit is for a better collaborative workability in start-ups and teams, and A.E.C had led a great shift in the education market for studying abroad in South Korea. The educational mentoring firms that have same beliefs were founded. I had realized something needs to be happened to change the situations both in collaboration for team and studying abroad system in South Korea. I have led my followers to have a belief that I believe, and they followed my way to change those problems with me.</p>
